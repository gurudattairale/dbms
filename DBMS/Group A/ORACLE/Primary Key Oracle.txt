SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint:

The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);

defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);

In the example above there is only ONE PRIMARY KEY (PK_Person). However, the VALUE of the primary key is made up of TWO COLUMNS (ID + LastName).

SQL PRIMARY KEY on ALTER TABLE:

ALTER TABLE Persons ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);

ALTER TABLE Persons ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName);

DROP a PRIMARY KEY Constraint:

ALTER TABLE Persons DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Person;


SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint:
SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

Look at the following two tables:
